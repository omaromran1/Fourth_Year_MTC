Impact: Delays in feedback may stall development or result in features that do not align with user needs.\par
Mitigation: Establish a clear communication plan with scheduled review sessions and designate a product owner to act as a liaison.\par
3. Balancing Iterative Development with Institutional Deadlines\par
Challenge: Educational institutions often operate on strict schedules (e.g., semester start dates). Agile's iterative nature may conflict with fixed deadlines.\par
Impact: Essential features may not be ready on time, affecting system deployment.\par
Mitigation: Prioritize critical features in early sprints and focus on delivering Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) for timely implementation.\par
4. Team Collaboration and Expertise\par
Challenge: Agile relies on cross-functional teams working collaboratively. A lack of experience in Agile practices or team misalignment can disrupt progress.\par
Impact: Miscommunication or uneven skill levels among team members can lead to inefficiencies and lower-quality output.\par
Mitigation: Provide Agile training for team members, promote open communication, and define roles and responsibilities clearly.\par
5. Managing Frequent Changes\par
Challenge: Frequent changes in requirements, even late in the development process, can lead to rework and increased costs.\par
Impact: The project may require more time and resources than initially anticipated.\par
Mitigation: Use robust change management practices and ensure changes are prioritized and validated before implementation.\par
6. Testing Challenges\par
Challenge: Continuous testing is essential in Agile, but integrating testing seamlessly into sprints can be resource-intensive.\par
Impact: Poorly executed testing processes may lead to undetected bugs or delays in delivery.\par

This script includes:

Keywords: Recognizes basic C++ keywords.

Identifiers: Matches variable and function names.

Numbers: Identifies integers and floating-point numbers.

Operators and Delimiters: Matches common operators, assignment, semicolons, braces, and parentheses.

Whitespace: Skips over whitespace.

Unknown: Catches any unrecognized characters for error handling.

This is a basic lexer and can be further expanded to include more keywords, different token types, and better error handling. If you need additional features or have specific requirements, let me know!
